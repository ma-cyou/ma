## Overview

This is my personal resume website, showcasing my skills, experience, and projects. It serves as a digital portfolio that highlights my journey as a developer and provides a platform for others to learn more about my work.

## Functional Description

This website is built using [**SvelteKit**](https://kit.svelte.dev/), a modern web framework that offers fast and dynamic interfaces. The UI design is based on a port of the popular [**shadcn UI**](https://ui.shadcn.com/) for Svelte, which can be found at [shadcn-svelte.com](https://www.shadcn-svelte.com).
